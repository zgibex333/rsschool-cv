## About myself

Graduate of Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno, Belarus (Faculty of Economics and Management; Specialty - World Economy, 2019). 
After graduation, I managed to work in logistics as a freight forwarder (half a year), and currently I work in an outsourcing IT company in the sales department (more than a year).
I started to get interested in programming after my first job. After a long thought, I decided that the **front-end** interests me most of all - in view of my past experience of drawing postcards in Photoshop and due to my love for visual staff. 
My **immediate goal** - to become good enough for position "Junior Front-end Developer" and to start internship in company located in Grodno or Minsk.

Key priorities:
- Take care of your loved ones
- Learn every day
- Become a professional in the field that you really like
- Create

## Technical skills 
- HTML (basics)
- CSS (basics)
- JavaScript (basics)
- GIT (basics)
- Webpack (basics)

## Code examples 


Here is a piece of JS code:
```javascript
start() {
        const interval = (60 / this.bpm) * 1000;
        //check playing
        if ( !this.isPlaying ) {
            this.isPlaying = setInterval(() => {
                this.repeat();
            }, interval)
        } else {
            clearInterval(this.isPlaying);
            this.isPlaying = null;
        }
    }
```
Can you explain what `this` means?
